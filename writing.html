			<p _text="title">(morning)</p>
			<p _text="words"> 
			I woke up this morning </br>
			With tears already pooling </br> 
			In my tired eyes. </br> 
			The alarm sounded too early. </br> 
			A nightmare plagued my sleep, </br>
			And I wondered how rested I was </br>
			Having woken up so many times. </br> 
			I headed for the bathroom and spent a moment </br>
			Staring into the mirror </br> 
			As if I would find some comfort there. </br> 
			I returned to the bedroom and found that my strength was diminished. </br> 
			The tears escaped and I felt angry and ashamed. </br> 
			I hate mornings like this. </br> 
			But you had a nightmare too, and sleepily </br> beckoned me into your arms. </br> 
			We shared our unpleasantries </br> 
			Allowing them to dissipate into the morning grey. </br> 
			I glanced at the clock. </br> 
			The relief vanished. </br> 
			Late again. </br> 
			New plan. </br> 
			I got ready and climbed back into bed </br>
			Milking you for cuddles before facing the real world. </br> 
			The front door is always a challenge to open. </br> 
			I fussed with it a few second too long, and watched the bus pass by. </br> 
			I felt the passages in my brain constrict as the stress grew more intense. </br> 
			It’s fine. It’s fine. </br> 
			I began to walk, oozing negativity. </br> 
			Then I heard the birds chirp, felt the cool air against my cheeks, and realized my advantage. </br>
			How many people are lucky enough to experience this beauty to start the day? </br> 
			I enjoyed the rest of my walk, caught the next bus, and read an interview with some graphic designers on the ride. </br> 
			I arrived, still a little tense, but less so. </br> 
			(A girl with a pink ukulele at her side has no reason to stress) </br> 
			From a distance, I saw a familiar face, who hollered that my class was cancelled. </br> 
			I sighed and smiled. </br> 
			My stress is as real as my nightmares. </br> 
			And rob me of my waking hours </br> 
			Like the latter robs me of my sleep. </br> 
			Learning not to worry is a trick. </br> 
			But it appears the universe is on my side </br>
			And is quite the patient teacher.
